一首小诗

```
New York is 3 hours ahead of California, but it does not make California slow.
Someone graduated at age of 22, and waited 5 years before securing a good job.
Someone became a CEO at 25, and died at 50.
another became a CEO at 50, but died at the age of 90.
Someone is still single, while someone else got married.
Obama retires at 55, while Trump starts at 70.
Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their time zone.
People around you might seem to be ahead of you.
Some might seem to be behind you, but everyone is running their own race.
In their own time, don't envy them or mock them.
They are in their time zone and you are iin yours.
Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.
So relax, 
you're not late, 
you're not early, 
you're very much on time, 
and in your time zone destiny set up for you.

纽约比加州快3个小时，但加州的时间并没有变慢。
有人22岁就毕业了，但等了5年才找到好的工作。
有人25岁就当上了CEO，却在50岁去世。
也有人50岁才当上CEO，然后活到90岁。
有的人依然单身，同时也有人已婚。
奥巴马55岁就退休了，川普70岁才当上总统。
世上每个人本来就有自己的发展时区。
身边有些人看似走在你前面，也有人看似走在你后面，但每个人都有自己的步程。
不用嫉妒或嘲笑他们。
他们在他们的时区里，你也是。
生命就是等待正确的行动时机。
所以，放轻松。
你没有落后，
你也没有领先，
一切都很准时，
在你自己的时区里，一切都是最好的安排。
